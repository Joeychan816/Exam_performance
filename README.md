#This project was about finding correlations between student exam scores and other variables such as but not limited to; study hours per day, mental health rating, total screen time, exercise frequency, etc. Afterwards, I looked at the top 5 variables with the highest correlation to exam scores and did created a linear model for them, finding the p-value and coefficient for each. Finally, I created a multi-linear regression model using those variables and created a heatmat correlation plot to visualize which variables had the largest correlation with exam scores.
